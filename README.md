Data analysis project - 2016 BC housing affordability and rental subsidies

**Overview**
The lack of affordable housing is a significant challenge faced by residents of British Columbia. To address this issue, the provincial government has implemented rental subsidies to alleviate shelter costs for low-income individuals. This data analysis project utilizes data from the 2016 Census for BC, found in the "BC census 2016 data.csv" file. The objective is to review shelter subsidization rates and assess if adjustments are needed to ensure equitable distribution based on regional needs.

**Tasks**

*Task 1: Community Health Service Areas (CHSA) Analysis*
Objective: Identify CHSAs where the percentage of renters spending 30% or more of their income on shelter costs exceeds 50%. Evaluate the appropriateness of rental subsidization rates in these areas by considering household income and rent prices.

*Task 2: Provincial Health Authority (PHA) Regional Analysis*
Objective: Examine shelter subsidization rates at the regional level of Provincial Health Authorities (PHA): Fraser, Interior, Northern, Vancouver Coastal, and Vancouver Island. Determine whether there are variations in subsidization rates across these five PHA regions.

**Data Source**
The data for this project is sourced from the "BC census 2016 data.csv" file, containing information from the 2016 Census.
Notebooks: Includes Jupyter notebooks for both tasks & stores the results and visualizations generated from the analysis.

**How to Use**
1. Open Google Colab or VS code
2. Upload the "BC census 2016 data.csv" file.
3. Extract and analyze data, including visual representations.
