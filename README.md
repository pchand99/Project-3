Data analysis project - 2016 BC housing affordability and rental subsidies

**Overview**

The lack of affordable housing is a significant challenge faced by residents of British Columbia. To address this issue, the provincial government has implemented rental subsidies to alleviate shelter costs for low-income individuals. This data analysis project utilizes data from the 2016 Census for BC, found in the "BC census 2016 data.csv" file. The objective is to review shelter subsidization rates and assess if adjustments are needed to ensure equitable distribution based on regional needs.

**Tasks**

*Task 1: Community Health Service Areas (CHSA) Analysis*
Objective: Identify CHSAs where the percentage of renters spending 30% or more of their income on shelter costs exceeds 50%. Evaluate the appropriateness of rental subsidization rates in these areas by considering household income and rent prices.

*Task 2: Provincial Health Authority (PHA) Regional Analysis*
Objective: Examine shelter subsidization rates at the regional level of Provincial Health Authorities (PHA): Fraser, Interior, Northern, Vancouver Coastal, and Vancouver Island. Determine whether there are variations in subsidization rates across these five PHA regions.

**Results**

*Task 1: Community Health Service Areas (CHSA) Analysis* 

Some areas household income & rent prices
1. Richmond City Centre: Income:  31,337Rent: 1,306 Percentage of Income Spent on Rent: 4.17%
2. University of British Columbia: Income:  48,139Rent: 1,747 Percentage of Income Spent on Rent: 3.63%
3. Sechelt: Income:  40,452Rent: 1,059 Percentage of Income Spent on Rent: 2.62%
--> Therefore, the calculated percentages of income spent on rent for these CHSAs are relatively low, ranging from around 2% to 4%.Suggesting that on average, residents in these areas can afford their housing costs without a significant financial burden.


*Task 2: Provincial Health Authority (PHA) Regional Analysis*
The average subsidization rates for shelter costs across the five Provincial Health Authority (PHA) regions:

1. Fraser Average Subsidization Rate: 2.56%
2. Interior Average Subsidization Rate: 2.22%
3. Northern Average Subsidization Rate: 1.84%
4. Vancouver Coastal Average Subsidization Rate: 2.62%
5. Vancouver Island Average Subsidization Rate: 2.23%
--> There are variations in the average subsidization rates across the PHA regions. Vancouver Coastal has the highest average subsidization rate (2.62%), while Northern has the lowest (1.84%).
